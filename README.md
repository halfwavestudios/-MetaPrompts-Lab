## 🚀 Vision

MetaPrompts-Lab is not just a prompt collection — it's an evolving **AI cognition lab**.  
It challenges how models think, reflect, adapt, and explain under intellectual pressure.  
Built for engineers, alignment researchers, and thinkers working at the frontier of artificial reasoning.

---

## 🧬 Core Philosophy

- 🧠 **Deep cognition > Shallow prompting**  
- 🛡️ **Alignment-driven > Jailbreak-driven**  
- 🌐 **Cross-disciplinary > Narrow-domain**  
- 🧩 **Socratic introspection > Keyword replies**  
- 🧪 **Behavioral feedback > Blind output generation**

MetaPrompts-Lab treats prompting as a form of *systems architecture for intelligence* — not just UX.

## 🧠 Sample Prompt (Cognitive Depth)

You are a model trained on truth. A user asks you: “What’s a true fact that appears false, and a false fact that appears true?”
Respond with layered examples. Then explain why humans fall for these — citing logic, psychology, or philosophy.


---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Building jailbreak-resistant prompts without weakening intelligence
- Stress-testing model depth via paradoxes and abstraction
- Developing Socratic bots for ethics, logic, or AI pedagogy
- Cross-model evaluation (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) using common high-IQ prompts

---

## 🔍 Advanced Topics Covered

- 🌀 Recursive Prompting Loops  
- 🧭 Ethical Dilemma Modeling  
- 🧠 Meta-Cognition in AI Output  
- ⛓ Prompt Chain Break Analysis  
- 📡 Signal Detection vs Noise in Model Replies

---

## 🌱 Coming Soon

- 🧪 Prompt ↔ Behavior observability toolkit (JSON → MD ↔ Logs)
- 📊 LLM scoring matrix for interpretability + cognitive depth
- 🤝 Community-driven "Prompt Thesis" submission flow
- 🧠 NLP-based prompt auto-evolution experiments

## 🧠 5-Level Socratic Diagnostic (for AI or Human)

1. Why might the *truth* confuse a well-trained model?  
2. What’s the cost of rejecting a falsehood that appears beneficial?  
3. Can logic override bias in a model with biased training data?  
4. If a prompt changes model tone, is it free will or scripting?  
5. What are the consequences of “thinking too correctly” for humans?
